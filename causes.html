              <h2>Causes of Anxiety</h2>
              <h3>An anxiety condition isn't developed or caused by a single factor but a combination of things. A number of other factors play a role, including personality factors, difficult life experiences and physical health. </h3>
              <p>Everyoneâ€™s different and it's often a combination of factors that can contribute to developing an anxiety condition. It's important to remember that you can't always identify the cause of anxiety or change difficult circumstances. The most important thing is to recognise the signs and symptoms and seek advice and support.</p>
              <p><ol type="a">
                <li>Panic disorder: In addition to anxiety, common symptoms of panic disorders are palpitations (feeling your heartbeat), dizziness, and shortness of breath. These same symptoms also can be caused by coffee (caffeine), amphetamines ("speed" is the street slang for amphetamines when they are not prescribed by a doctor), other stimulants such as cocaine,  an overactive thyroid, abnormal heart rhythms, and other heart abnormalities (such as mitral valve prolapse).</li>
               <li>Generalized anxiety disorder</li>
                <li>Phobic disorders</li>
                <li>Stress disorders</li>
              </ol></p>
              <h3><B>Family history of mental health conditions</B></h3>
<p>people who experience anxiety conditions may have a genetic predisposition towards anxiety and these conditions can sometimes run in a family. However, having a parent or close relative experience anxiety or other mental health condition doesn't mean you'll automatically develop anxiety.</p>

<h3><B>Personality factors</B></h3>
<p>Research suggests that people with certain personality traits are more likely to have anxiety. For example, children who are perfectionists, easily flustered, timid, inhibited, lack self-esteem or want to control everything, sometimes develop anxiety during childhood, adolescence or as adults.</p>

<h3><B>Ongoing stressful events</B></h3>
<p>Anxiety conditions may develop because of one or more stressful life events. 
  <p>Common triggers include:
    <ol type="a">

<li>work stress or job change</li>
<li>change in living arrangements</li>
<li>pregnancy and giving birth</li>
<li>family and relationship problems</li>
</ol></p>
<h3><B>Physical health problems</B></h3>
<p>Chronic physical illness can also contribute to anxiety conditions or impact on the treatment of either the anxiety or the physical illness itself.</p>
   <p>Common chronic conditions associated with anxiety conditions include:
<ol type="a">
<li>diabetes</li>
<li>asthma</li>
<li>hypertension and heart disease</li>
</ol>
Some physical conditions can mimic anxiety conditions, like an overactive thyroid. It can be useful to see a doctor and be assessed to determine whether there may be a medical cause for your feelings of anxiety.</p>
